        <h3>Angela Ruiz</h3>
        <p>Angela has lived in the community for many years and owns a small breakfast
            restaurant that serves Mexican food. This business has helped her be a major
            provider for her family. She is currently 45 years old and has two children.
            Lately she feels her business has fallen behind as more big chains have moved
            into the neighborhood. Now she is looking for ways to better reach her customers
            and remain a well known restaurant in the area.

            selling Salvadorian food. He has put in a lot of hard work and his business
            is doing well in the neighborhood. Now he wants to get more involved in the 
            community and see what he can do to better his business image.
